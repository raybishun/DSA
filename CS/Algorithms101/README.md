## Big-O
* Measure an algorithm's efficiency,
* by comparing its Time Complexity and Space Complexity,
* regardless of input size.
* Tells you best-case, average-case, and worst-case.

## Big-O Notations
* O(1) = constant time, (most efficient - best case): item we're searching for will be the first or last element.
* O(n) = linear time: search each item in collection, (n) is the input size.
* O(log(n)) = logarithmic time.
* O(n!) = factorial time
* O(n2) = exponential time, (least efficient - worst case).
