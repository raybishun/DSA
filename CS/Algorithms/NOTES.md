## Big-O
* Measure an algorithm's efficiency.
* Compare algorithms regardless of input size.
* Time Complexity and Space Complexity.

## Big-O Notations
* O(1) = constant time, (most efficient): item we're searching for will be the first or last element.
* O(n) = linear time: search each item in collection, (n) is the input size.
* O(log(n)) = logarithmic time.
* O(n!) = factorial time
* O(n2) = exponential time, (least efficient).
